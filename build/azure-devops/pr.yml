# Why not a Container Job?
# The official amazon/aws-cli:2.1.26 (at least) container is not set up for Azure DevOps Container Usage: 'useradd' executable not found (etc)
# More information here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops
#
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Be careful! If your key includes + or /, you might get SignatureDoesNotMatch errors (or similar)
# More information here: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/602
# In summary: generate AWS Credentials until they do not have a + or /. 
#
# Try as I may: I could not get aws cli working with Bash@3 on Ubuntu or with PowerShell@2 on Windows: the AWS Toolkit for Azure DevOps does work (on Windows VM Pool)
# Create a Service Connection to AWS; give this YAML Pipeline permission to access the Service Connection Resource; and put that resource name in the awsCredentials property of the AWS Task
#    See: templates/validate-cf-template.yml
#    See: (for Service Connection): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vsts/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#set-up-aws-credentials-for-the-aws-tools-for-vsts
#    Turn off PR builds for Forks (and especially sharing of secrets): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/security/repos?view=azure-devops
#    Recommendation: Manually trigger fork builds using comments
